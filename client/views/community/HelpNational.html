    National coaches are elected by community for the period of two seasons. Whoever gets the most votes on the election becomes national coach. If two or more users receive the same amount of votes, user who signed for the game first is elected. In his first season national coach tries to qualify for World Cup with his team. In every second season 30 countries compete in the World Cup and other teams play friendly matches in order to improve and build for the future. If coach becomes vacant during the two seasons time, re-election is not possible. Using cheating methods during election results in user disqualification, this includes creating accounts in foreign countries, creating multiple accounts and sending spam messages to other users. Campaign can only be advertised on Basketsim forums and not by using private messages.<br/>

    <br/>National team can have up to 14 players in the roster. It's up to national coach which players to enroll, as long as they are of suitable nationality and age and not clubless. He can also remove any player from national team for any reason, but this affects team mood in a negative way. The same goes for enrolling, just that negative effect is smaller. Club owners can't withdraw their player from national team, but good communication between them and NT coach is advisable.<br/>

    <br/>Feature specific for national teams is "players say". It's a mood of the players in team, who comment on their national coach. Players always act as a team, so it's logical that teams with many changes in the roster tend to have worse team mood. Results also affect players, but not every win and loss is the same. The explanation for this is below.<br/>

    <br>Beside offensive and defensive tactics, coaches must also set attitude when setting up tactics for matches. Attitude have impact on various elements of national teams. There are several approaches available:<br/>
    - <u>take it easy</u>: players won't play at their full capabilities. If team scores a win the mood won't increase by much. If the team losses, the mood won't drop by much. During the match players will have hard time playing defense and there will be some negative impact towards their rebounding capabilities. However the impact to rebounding is much smaller as impact of skills and tactics. The good thing when playing take it easy is that players will be very relaxed, so they will score freethrows with more ease then usual. Also the chance for injuries is lowered by much.<br/>
    - <u>play for the crowd</u>: players will do anything to please the crowd. If the team wins the mood will increase by much, if the team loses this will result in mediocre drop of mood. During the match, players won't focus on defense so much, they will try to make it a high scoring match. Chances for injuries are somehow lowered with this approach.<br/>
    - <u>normal approach</u>: this is a normal attitude that shouldn't be confused with normal tactical approach. Normal attitude means that engine will work as usual for any team matches. The mood raise (in case of win) or drop (in case of loss) after the match will be an average one.<br/>
    - <u>very important match</u>: players will get the signal to really go for it in the next match. If they win the mood will increase by much, if they lose the mood will drop by much. It is significant for this approach that players will play slightly better defense as usual, but they will get tired more and the chances for injuries will be increased!<br/>
    - <u>match of the century</u>: players will face the fact that next match is absolutely cruical for the team. They will respond with strong defensive performance and they will have bonus on their rebounding capabilities. Ofcourse the bonus is much smaller as the impact of skills and it's also important to know that players will be nervous and this may result in more missed freethrow attempts. Chances for injuries will increase and there will be more tiredness involved. If the team wins the mood will go up big time as the goal was achieved. If team losses the mood will drop to some degree, the drop won't be too big as the players were already told that it's a cruical match, so loss was always possible.<br/>

    <br/>In case of a walkover loss, severe drop in national team mood is possible and this even include friendly matches, which otherwise have no impact on morale at all. NT coaches should always make sure that full lineup is set, including the reserve players, not just starting five.<br/>

    <br/>We've already mentioned team mood several times - there are some things specific for national teams. Mood have an impact towards team performance when it comes to turnovers. Home court advantage have impact to team's shooting performance. Another thing worth mentioning is tiredness gain for starting players in NT matches. Tiredness is lower comparing to club matches, so that players can play for club and national team at once without being too tired. Players also receive extra experience points when they start for their national team. Exprience gain for starting five players in World Cup and WC Qualifying matches is significantly higher to experience gain in club matches. There is ofcourse also some experience gain in national team friendly matches.<br/>

    <br/>Another important thing to consider when it comes to national teams are team captains. It's important to pick a captain who will appear in most matches, because a team captain will always fight extra hard for his country and when he will be absent, that extra bit will be missing. Ofcourse changing team captain is an option too, but that results in a team mood drop!<br/>

    <br/>National coaches control several other features, they can set up national team home and away shirts, publish statement and set up players shirt numbers. When scouting for players they don't have special tools, but they can use the help of community and existing tools like club rosters, transfer histories, supporter stats data.<br/>

    <br/>Same user can't control two national teams at once. It's up to agreement between U19 and senior coach if some very talented U19 player should play for senior or junior national team. When players reach the age of 20, they must be removed from U19 selections before first match day of the season (Friday). If not, International Basketsim Federation removes them, but this can be extra bad for the national team mood.<br/>

    <br/>When World Cup is over, history page is created, best starting five and MVP of the tournament and final are called. Players from top three countries receive medals. All players who were part of the team in any World Cup game are eligible to receive a medal. Managers and nations also receive medals, for managers they are visible on club page and for nations on senior or junior page of national team. After period of two seasons is completed, elections for new national coaches take place. Same manager can be re elected several times, it all depends on the trust of community in his work. After each election morale for national teams changes, values tend to normalize, low levels are increased and high levels somewhat lowered.<br/>
