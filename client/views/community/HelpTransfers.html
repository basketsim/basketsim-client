    Basketsim has a transfer market, where you can either sell or buy players. There are some regulations which make sure that market works in fair and transparent way. When player is listed for sale, maximum starting price is limited to 1.5-times his evaluated value (will be adjusted to 1 x EV in the future). When you are bidding on a player, you can't raise bid further until someone else bids higher. When buying and selling players, you should be familiar with agent fees system. When you place player for sale you don't pay anything, but according to the time when that player was last transfered, agents fees might apply if he gets sold. If player was purchased and then sold in 60 days time or less, then the earnings are taxed. For a player who was sold just 1 day after a purchase you will get 0% of the earnings and for a player who was sold 61 days after a purchase you will get 100% of the earnings. For example: you purchased a player only 1 day ago, but have decided to sell him. You purchased him for 350.000 € and after 1 day he was sold for 700.000 €. You will receive 350.000 €. Selling him after 31 days would give you 525.000 € and selling him after 61 days would give you 700.000 €. This system gives you a chance to drop a player if you have changed your mind after a purchase. You must be especially careful if you have purchased back your own player and you are selling him again before 60 days period has expired. 10% of player's last achieved price will be taken into account for calculation of agent fees, so you can lose a lot of money. This is because bidding on own player is an option, only intended for those who changed their mind about selling the player and not as a way to raise his price.<br/>

    <br/>It's important to know that overpriced transfers are not allowed! It's absolutely forbidden to arrange transfer at a price above the market price or to gift money to other managers by buying their players above the reasonable market price. In case of cheating, unreasonable sale prices or prearranged transfer deals, the gamemasters can either adjust the price or disallow the transfer. Prices should always be determined by the market in a fair bidding process where unrelated clubs bid against each other. If someone suggest you to bid mutually on a player until certain price is reached, refuse it and report him to the gamemasters, because raising the price in such a way would be cheating!<br/>

    <h4>Scouting</h4>
    From time to time you might want to hire a scout to find a Free Agent to sign up and play for your club. The better the scout is and the more time he has, the more likely he is to find a good player. Every time you hire new scout you pay 3.000 &euro;. Scout is then assigned to you and if you are not happy with his skills you can hire a new one for another 3.000 &euro;. When you are happy with your scout you may want to send him searching for players. He uses his prefered locations and skills to narrow down the selection, so if you are looking for a certain skill or nationality you can just pick scout who suits your needs best. Most important skill for scouts is scouting ability - best scouts won't even bother to check low quality players. Feel for the talent can also be important if you want better chances for a young pick.<br/>

    <br/>Scouting is an active procedure, both for scout and club manager. Every day scout reports back to you and offers a free agent available for signup. The decision is entirely on you, either to sign, either to pass and hope that better player shows up. After each update when you have scout hired, you are able to sign player who was found last. Chances to get really good player increase as scout spends more time searching for players. When you send scout to search for players you pay additional fee, regardless of scout's quality. It only depends on maximum number of days - scout demands 10.000 &euro per day and he doesn't care if search ends after one day. He is contracted to offer several players or to offer one that you sign up and if he finds good player in one day, he still gets a full fee. Additionally, players will demand sign-up fee to be prepared to sign contract for you. After the job is done, scout leaves club and therefore he opens spot for you to hire a new scout. You can't have more then one scout searching for players at the time.<br/>

    <br/>With the scout search, there is always a small chance that scout won't find new player in one or two days of his search. Another rare scenario is that two scouts find the same player, so he can already be signed when you try to sign him. Scout can also test your decisions by offering you the same player for the second time. You can refuse all his offers, but if you don't pick a player before the search is over, scout will leave club and you won't sign a new player. The last day to sign a player is when scout is saying there are 0 searching days left.<br/>
