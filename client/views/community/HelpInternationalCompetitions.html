    There are three international competitions in Basketsim. Two of those are reserved for the best teams from previous season. Best teams from national leagues compete in Champions Series (CS) and best teams from national cups compete in Cup Winners Series (CWS), with exception of teams already accepted to play in CS. Countries with greater success from the past can get additional spots in both competitions. If cup semifinalists or quarterfinalists are eligible to play in CWS, score difference and points scored are used to separate amongst them. Both, CS and CWS, are played as playoff series. If one team wins first two matches they win the series with 2-0, else third match decides the series. Since season 9 there is a single final match deciding the winner in both competitions.<br/>

    <br/>Money generated from the attendance is given to the International Basketsim Federation (IBF) and teams are awarded after their elimination from the contest. You can see the structure of awards in the table below.<br/><br/>

    <br/>Teams get additional money from sponsors on weekly basis while competing in CS or CWS. This amount depends on the type of competition, success and quality of the starting five in team's last home match. From financial point of view it's important to play your star players at home, because that attracts VIP visitors and as result, sponsors give team more money (from competitive perspective there is no home advantage in CS/CWS). Fatigue for players is lower in CS and CWS matches if we compare them with league matches, while experience-gain is higher. Player can pick an injury while performing in CS/CWS, but harsh injuries are uncommon. CS/CWS matches don't count towards training, so player must still be involved in league, cup or friendly starting five to be eligible for training.<br/>

    <h4>Fair Play Cup (FPC)</h4>
    Third international cup in Basketsim is known as the Fair Play Cup (FPC). This is a "thank you cup" for all Basketsim supporters. It gives managers an opportunity to play international matches against opponents from all over the World. FPC is played in a two-phase format. First phase is a group round with 6 teams in each of the approximately 210 groups. Top two teams from every group and some of the best 3rd placed teams qualify for the elimination stage, which is played in the format similar to national cups: every loss is eliminating one. Players don't get tired while playing FPC and there are no significant injuries. The awards that winners can expect are endless amount of joy and pride over the beautiful trophy and also an entry to the next season Champions Series! Also, if you are chasing flags, FPC duels can ease your task of completing your flags collection. Loyal supporters of the game will be happy to notice that 10 appearances in the Fair Play Cup bring a special trophy to the club's trophy room. FPC is ofcourse competitive event, but the larger purpose behind it is for teams and managers from various countries and even continents to get in touch and not just enjoy their mutual games, but perhaps also their correspondence in form of personal messages or exchanged guestbook entries. FPC is really not the place to worry about not being competitive, just go out there, give your best and enjoy the additional matches, with no usual league or cup pressure!<br/>
