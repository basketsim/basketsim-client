    Each Basketsim player has 10 basic skills. But there are some other factors that can affect his performance. Physical characteristics (height and weight) are important and tiredness can also affect players in a negative way. A player's personality can also be important in certain situations. We will explain this further, later in this chapter.<br/>

    <br/><b>Ballhandling</b> - this is a basic skill for any basketball player. Every player must be able to handle ball in some situations, but some players handle the ball much more often then others. This ability is most important for guards, especially point guards. If PG's handling is weak, team is very vulnerable to make more turnovers.<br/>

    <br/><b>Quickness</b> - a very important ability for any player on the court. Quickness is the combination of speed and reflexes. Quick players are likely to make more steals, converting them into easy-scoring fast breaks. Forwards and centers with fast reflexes will often outsmart taller opponents and win a rebound. Shooters can also benefit from being quick, getting cleaner shots, to improve their 2-points average.<br/>

    <br/><b>Passing</b> - having good passers in the team is always a good idea. Every player will have to pass the ball sometimes and if he can't pass well, he is likely to make a turnover. Passing is important for guards, but forwards with good passing can improve reliablity of the team.<br/>

    <br/><b>Dribbling</b> - is ability that combines well with quickness and ballhandling. Add some defense and shooting and you have a decent guard. Players with a good ability to dribble are likely to cut inside and score or force their opponent to foul them. Centers will rarely need to dribble the ball. Guards and forwards with low dribbling ability are more prone to lose the ball.<br/>

    <br/><b>Rebounding</b> - rebounding is a very important aspect of basketball, and being able to jump high and grab the ball can win the match for your team. Any player playing as a forward or a center should be at least an average rebounder, unless the combination of his positioning and quickness is so good that he will simply outsmart opponents.<br/>

    <br/><b>Positioning</b> - basketball is much more than grabbing, handling and passing the ball. Two skills determine how good players are off the ball - defense and positioning. Positioning is important for all players. Centers and forwards will fully use their rebounding skill only if they are able to position well. Good positioning can be essential for any player to find a clear shooting position, especially for long-distance shots.<br/>

    <br/><b>Freethrows</b> - being able to convert free throws can be essential for a team's succes. If the opponent is closing you down, attacks will often end with a personal foul. When it comes to free throw attempts no other skill will help the player taking the shots to get 2 out of 2.<br/>

    <br/><b>Shooting</b> - shooting is an important skill for any player but bear in mind that shooting success often depends on the  combination of many abilities. A top guard with average shooting is more likely to score than a superb shooter with no supporting skills. If a player can't cut in, if he's unable to position well, his attempts are more likely to get blocked. When it comes to long distance shooting, shooting becomes more important.<br/>

    <br/><b>Defense</b> - very important skill especially in combination with a high quickness ability. High-defense players will usualy make fewer personal fouls, more steals and in general they will make it tougher for the opponent's offense to penetrate your defense. Having such players also increases the chances of your opponent making an offensive foul.<br/>

    <br/><b>Work rate</b> - work rate is not exactly a skill, it's a mixture of ability and character. Players with high workrate work harder! The player with the highest work-rate ever was probably Michael Jordan, so if you want to develop a star, a high work rate is a good start. But there are always some decent not-so-hard-working players around, so don't worry if some of your players are not so hard working. Details on the benefits of this skill can be found in the training chapter of the game rules, as this skill is only valuable for player's training and progress. Workrate levels above skill 15 are very rare.<br/>

    <br/><b>Experience</b> - experience cannot be learnt, it has to be earned. Every basketball player was once an inexperienced youngster but after playing more and more matches he gained experience. The same goes for Basketsim players. And while all skills can be improved over the level perfect, experience is the only skill where you'll actually see the exact level once your player reaches the level above 15. However that kind of experience levels are usually only reserved for players with fantasic history, not just at club but also in the national team.<br/>

    <br/><br/><big>OTHER INFLUENCES</big><br/><br/>

    <table class="table table-condensed table-striped league">
    <tr><td>All match events can be affected by <b>experience</b>, some more, like three point shooting, and some less, like steals.</td></tr>

    <tr><td><b>Tiredness</b> affects player's ability to rebound, score for two and convert free throws. It increases player's chances to commit foul or make turnover. Tiredness can be very important, especially high levels can make players perform much worse as usual. Leisure training is one method of addressing the tiredness issue in your team, players will train less but they'll get much needed rest. When season ends, tiredness is halved for all players.</td></tr>

    <tr><td>Some match events can be highly affected by <b>height</b> and <b>weight</b>, like rebounding, 2-point shooting and turnovers. There are certain ranges of ideal height and weight for each playing position. Point Guards are typically around 185-190 cm tall while other positions demand higher players. Ideal height for centers is around 215 cm and even more is welcome. It's similar with weight, while centers can benfit of having 120 kg or more, small forwards have ideal value at around 100 kg and point guards will do just fine when having 85 kg or less.</td></tr>

    <tr><td>A player having a <b>bad day</b> means that player's performance in the match was on the bottom of his capability. Players have their ups and downs, they performance is not the same in every match. You will typically recognize player having a bad day, just like you will recognize when he shines in the match.</td></tr>

    <tr><td>In league matches, players gain a <b>bonus when playing at home</b>. It's the boost given by the fans and the cheerleaders and it affects skills that are related to player's aggressiveness or mental approach, namely rebounds, defense, freethrows, speed and passing.</td></tr>

<!--     <br/>Personal characteristic of players can also have an impact on their Youth team development. Before player signs his first pro-contract, the pure joy for basketball is surely one of the important factors in his progression. When dealing with youth players, you have to understand what skills they tend to develop better or worse according to their character. Selfish players are the most obvious example, when focusing on shooting and dribbling they'll be much more motivated as if you make them focus on passing or defense. Calm and stable players tend to discover their strengths, when focused on shooting, speaking for stable players alone, they can reach masterclass at freethrows even at young age and they can soon become very good at ball handling. Calm players might have a problem when they are tackling quickness, which is pretty much the same we can tell for controversial players and positioning. Aggressive players are always hungry to rebound the ball within their reach and this can also reflect in their early development. Entertainers are often on court with primary goal to impress the audience. They'll be very motivated when their focus is set on dribbling, skill which enables them execution of breathtaking-moves. Clumsy characters will suffer when learning the tehnical skills, but coaches will push them stronger when they develop rebounding and positioning. Explosive players will have easy time developing good quickness, but could suffer in some other areas. For wise players it's quite the opposite, quickness could be an issue, but passing is their speciality. Fragile players are a fast learners, you can consider them as real stars and they'll make it big time, as long as they can stay healthy. Tough and lazy characters are the last two to be mentioned in that mix - first are pre-set to become strong defensive players, exactly an area where lazy players will definitely suffer, but both could be having issues with their speed levels. Character of youths can result in 1 to almost 3 full skills difference between otherwise similar players, given that their other training conditions are similar.<br/> -->

<!--     <br/><big>RATINGS</big><br/>

    <br/>After each match the five starting players are awarded a star rating, according to their quality and performance. Each player's ratings can vary from match to match, but not too greatly, if he plays in the same position as the last match. Players can improve their star ratings with lots of hard work and dedication during the training process.<br/>

    <br/>Apart from star ratings, you can see a player's statistics for any match that he played in (if he played at least one minute). You should combine both, star ratings and player's statistics when you are trying to evaluate a player. You can also track a player's average statistics from all his matches on his personal statistics page.<br/> -->

    <br/><strong>Injuries</strong>

    <br/>Any player can get injured when he playing the match. You can lower the chances for injuries by improving your medical facilities. An injury can take 0-9 weeks to heal. A red cross with the appropriate number will appear next to the player's name on the players' list. If the number is green, then the player can play in the next match despite the injury but his chances to get injured will be somewhat higher. Injuries usually heal a bit faster than the time the doctors predicted immediately after the injury occurred but this also depends on the medical staff, for example having medical center on level 5 will ensure your players to recover at double speed comparing to team that is without medical center. In addition to this medical center gives your player deduction of tiredness of 1% per level per week.<br/>

    <br/>Players can also get injured during training. Medical center has no influence in that case, it's important that your players are not too fatigued before training, as their chances to pick an injury during training increase with their tiredness.<br/>

    <br/><strong>MVP</strong>

    <br/>When a Basketsim season ends, the most valuable player (MVP) for each league is announced. Players with at least 500 minutes of league gametime are sorted by their total rating divided by their gametime. This means that if a player is leading the average stats, he can still end up NOT winning the MVP award. It's possible that his ratings were achieved with a lot of gametime compared to his rival players (league stats are only shown per match, not per 40 minutes, however supporters are able to check the MVP race stats during the season as well). Players who are awarded with MVP receive a silver trophy and players who are awarded with the country MVP receive a golden one. The global MVP player receives a special cup. Players that are no longer playing in the same team are still able to win the trophy based on their past league performances. The league MVP's club is awarded with 50.000 €.<br/>

    <br/>Here is an explanation how player MVP awards in the game are won:<br/>
    - league: best average of all players with at least 500 minutes played<br/>
    - country: best average amongst the league MVP winners combined with league strength<br/>
    - national cup, FPC and YCWC: best accumulated stats over the season<br/>
    - CS and CWS: best average amongst players with at least 12 matches played<br/>
    - global: determined individually, given to a player with the biggest impact on a season<br/>
